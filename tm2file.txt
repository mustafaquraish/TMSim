Language of this TM: L = { 0^2^n | n is a natural number }

Note 1: We're using the minus sign ('-') as the blank.
Note 2: See how any text
  * after the fourth token on the first line, or
  * after the fifth token on subsequent lines, or
  * after an empty line
 is treated as comments (i.e., ignored) by the program tm.py.
 ***  This means you can include comments in your TM descriptions.  ***
Note 3: Transitions to the reject state (qR) need not be explicitly given.
 The program makes these transitions by default.
